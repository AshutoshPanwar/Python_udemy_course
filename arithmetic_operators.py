#in total there are 7 arithmetic operators in python
print(3 + 4)    #adding two integers will give ans in integer
print(2.5 * 2)  #operation between float or int will always give us float numbers
print(2 - 15)   #ans would be an integer

#Division(/) operator result is always float..
print(10 / 2)   #output: 5.0 which is float

#Modulus(%) operator will returns the remainder in integer or float value
print(14 % 4)   #3*4+2 = 2 remainder
print(14.75 % 4)#3*4+2.75 = 2.75 remainde

#Exponential(**) operator become power of the number
print(2 ** 3)   #2*2*2 = 8
print(3.5 ** 2) #3.5*3.5 = 12.25
